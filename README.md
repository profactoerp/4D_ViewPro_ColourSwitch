# 4D_ViewPro_ColourSwitch
Switching Colors in 4DViewPro UI via CSS - Files through code commands.

This code has been developed via the 4D Professional Services by [Reda Mourad](https://github.com/reda-mourad) and is sponsored by [extragroup GmbH](https://extragroup.de). So a big thank you goes to Reda in the first place! Also to Stephan Schäfer from 4D-Deutschland, who made this cooperation possible.

For further requests, or additions please contact [Ulf Röttger](https://gibhub.com/urms) from [extragroup GmbH](https://extragroup.de) as Product Manager of profacto and initiator of this project.

The main purpose is to change the colour-scheme and file-names to make it a sort of 'white-label' feature to any 4D solution. 

Feel free to use it in your project and I would love to hear of any implementation and how we can go beyond.

As it is issued under the MIT license, please refer the credits of ownership, but also to Reda as the actual developer.
